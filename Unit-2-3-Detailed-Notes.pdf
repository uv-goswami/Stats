# UNIT II: Statistical Control Charts

## Overview
**Duration**: 20 Hours  
**Focus**: Construction and statistical basis of control charts, variables and attributes, process capability, chart patterns.

---

## 1. Statistical Basis of Control Charts
- **Control Charts** are graphical tools for monitoring process stability and detecting out-of-control (assignable causes) situations.
- **Basis**: Three-sigma (3σ) control limits are standard. For a normal process, about 99.73% of data is within ±3σ bounds.
- **Advantages**: Easily visualizes process trends and shifts, helps prevent defects and avoid unnecessary adjustments, enables process improvement and diagnosis.
- **Disadvantages**: Assumption of independence/normality may not hold, sensitive to sample size and frequency, sometimes confusing for operators (false alarms, warning limits).

---

## 2. Control Charts for Variables (X-bar, R-chart, S-chart)
- **X-bar Chart**: Monitors process mean (central tendency). 
- **R-chart**: Tracks range (variability) within subgroups.
- **S-chart**: Monitors subgroup standard deviation (process spread).
- **Rational Sub-grouping**: Subgroups should maximize the ability to detect process shifts between groups and minimize variation within a group.
- **Revised/Modified Limits**: Limits should be periodically revised—exclude any out-of-control points with assignable causes.

**Advantages**: Detect shifts in mean/variability quickly, effective for continuous measurement data, improve process capability by targeted investigation.

**Disadvantages**: More complex than attribute charts, requires careful data collection and rational subgrouping, sensitive to process autocorrelation and non-normality.

---

## 3. Control Charts for Attributes (np-chart, p-chart, c-chart, u-chart)
- **np-chart**: Monitors the number of defective items in a fixed-size sample.
- **p-chart**: Monitors the proportion of defective items (variable sample size).
- **c-chart**: Tracks the number of defects per unit (fixed area/volume).
- **u-chart**: Tracks the number of defects per inspection unit (variable unit size).

**Advantages**: Simple implementation, effective for pass/fail or defect counts, applicable when measurements are not continuous.

**Disadvantages**: Less sensitive than variable charts, may not detect small process shifts, does not provide detailed quantitative variability info.

## 4. Comparison: Variable vs Attribute Charts
| Feature                | Variables Charts (X-bar, R, S) | Attributes Charts (p, np, c, u) |
|----------------------- |------------------------------- |---------------------------------|
| Data Type              | Continuous (measurements)      | Discrete (count, pass/fail)     |
| Sensitivity            | Higher (detect small shifts)   | Lower                           |
| Complexity             | More complex                   | Simpler                         |
| Use Case               | Precision manufacturing        | Final inspection, simple checks  |

---

## 5. Patterns Analysis, Estimation of Process Capability
- **Patterns on Control Charts**:
  - Runs, trends, cycles, and non-random behavior may indicate assignable cause
  - Standard rules (Western Electric rules): 1 point outside ±3σ, 8 points on one side of CL, 6 points trending up/down, etc.
- **Process Capability**:
  - Estimated via control chart (process mean, spread, Cp/Cpk ratios)
  - Cp > 1: process within specification limits, process capable
  - Out-of-control signals require investigation and possible revision

## 6. Advantages & Disadvantages of Control Chart Approach
| Advantages                               | Disadvantages                                 |
|----------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------|
| Early detection of changes/defects       | Statistical assumptions may be violated        |
| Prevent excessive process adjustments    | Sensitive to sample strategy                   |
| Data-driven improvement                  | Chart design can be confusing for operators    |
| Reduced costs, improved product quality  | Needs investment in measurement/analysis       |
| Assess process capability                | May give false signals (false alarms)          |
| Supports continuous improvement          | Handling autocorrelated/non-normal data        |

# UNIT III: Acceptance Sampling Plan

## Overview
**Duration**: 15 Hours  
**Focus**: Principles of sampling plans, interpretation of OC, AQL, LTPD, AOQ, ASN, ATI, Dodge-Romig tables.

---

## 1. Principle of Acceptance Sampling Plans
- **Acceptance Sampling**: Evaluating a lot by inspecting a sample to accept or reject the whole lot.
- **Single Sampling Plan**: Predetermined sample size, decision rule based on number of defectives found.

---

## 2. Key Concepts and Functions
- **OC Curve (Operating Characteristic)**: Probability of accepting a lot as a function of fraction defective.
- **AQL (Acceptable Quality Level)**: Maximum tolerable percentage of defectives for acceptance.
- **LTPD (Lot Tolerance Percent Defective)**: Upper limit fraction defective, beyond which lot is likely to be rejected.
- **AOQ (Average Outgoing Quality)**: Average quality of accepted lots, considering rejected lots replaced with good items.
- **AOQL (Average Outgoing Quality Limit)**: Maximum AOQ;
- **ASN (Average Sample Number)**: Average number of samples inspected before making a decision.
- **ATI (Average Total Inspection)**: Expected total number of items inspected (sample, possibly entire lot).

---

## 3. Use and Interpretation of Dodge and Romig Tables
- **Dodge-Romig Tables**: Provide sample sizes and acceptance numbers for given producer and consumer risks, AQL, LTPD values.
- Used to select appropriate single/multiple sampling plans for inspection.

---

## 4. Graphical Interpretation
- OC, ASN, and AOQL curves help visualize plan performance and risk profiles.
- Graphs help designers optimize between inspection effort, risk, and quality levels.

---

## 5. Advantages & Disadvantages of Acceptance Sampling
| Advantages                               | Disadvantages                                 |
|----------------------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------|
| Lower inspection cost vs 100% inspection | Risk of accepting/rejecting wrong lots          |
| Objective, statistical basis             | Does not improve process quality directly      |
| Can be tailored to risk requirements     | Not suitable for very high-quality processes   |
| Useful for incoming/outgoing lots        | Relies on accuracy of sample and randomization |

## 6. Summary Table: Most Important Functions
| Function | Meaning                                    | Use                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| OC       | Probability of acceptance vs fraction defective | Risk profile for plan design         |
| AQL      | Acceptable Quality Level                   | Assured for producer, system design    |
| LTPD     | Lot Tolerance % Defective                  | Consumer protection                    |
| AOQ/AOQL | Outgoing quality expectation/limit         | Quality control evaluation             |
| ASN      | Average sample number                      | Inspection workload estimate           |
| ATI      | Average total inspection                   | Overall effort, especially with rejected lots |

---

## 7. Practical Notes
- Acceptance sampling is best used when process is stable and otherwise high quality.
- Sampling plans should be designed considering both cost and risk, using statistical tables and OC/AQL curves.
- Use Dodge-Romig tables for efficient and statistically valid plan selection.
